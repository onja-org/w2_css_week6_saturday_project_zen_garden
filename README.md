- **Color Harmony**: Stone-inspired palette with subtle transparency

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Navigate to `/lab/`** directory
2. **Read the implementation guide** in `/lab/README.md`
3. **Open `lab/index.html`** in your browser
4. **Edit `lab/index.html`** to implement the design
5. **Use the design images** in `/lab/assets/` as reference
6. **Check `lab/content.md`** for the text content
7. **View `lab/solution.html`** only as a last resort

## ⏰ Time Allocation
- **Total time**: 3.5 hours
- **Mobile-first**: Start with mobile layout
- **Desktop enhancement**: Add `md:` prefixes for larger screens
- **Testing**: Frequently check responsive behavior
